Interactive tool for identifying energy-intensive industries for powershoring in Morocco.

Built by the Harvard Growth Lab in collaboration with UM6P's Economics & Complexity Unit.

## Stages

1. **Filtering** - Set energy intensity and trade volume thresholds to define the candidate universe
2. **Likelihood** - Score products by how likely they are to powershore
3. **Prioritization** - Rank products by feasibility and attractiveness for Morocco
4. **Comparison** - Compare different scenarios side by side
